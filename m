The encrypted filename is only used by the file system; it's not
anything which is visible outside of the file system --- if it does,
such as passing it to the security subsystem, it's a bug.

Secondly, remember that the encrypted filename is a binary blob, and
may contain hex 00 as part of the encrypted filename.  So ***any***
code that tries to use NULL termination for the encrypted filename by
definition is a bug.  In other words, you must use memcpy, and not
strcpy.  If you use strcpy, even if you did add a NUL character to the
end of the encrypted filename (which is a bit of a misnomer because it
is a binary blob, not an ASCII string, so NUL is really not
technically correct), there will be encrypted filenames where strcpy
will stop early, because there is a 0x00 byte in the encrypted
filename.

Hence, other file systems MUST NOT traverse the encrypted filename
directly, because treating it as a NUL-terminated string when it is
really a binary blob of bits that can include a 0x00 byte is by
definition a BUG.

Cheers,
