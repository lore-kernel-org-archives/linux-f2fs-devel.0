Thanks for digging into the btrfs commit which changed the behavior
tested by this testcase, I had meant to do that. 

Yeah, that's all fair, for sure.  But this shouldn't be implicit in the
testcase; it should explicitly document that it is testing a de-facto
new standard adhered to by several filesystems, what that standard is,
etc, and not leave it to the reader.  ;)  

If a filesystem explicitly chooses not to adhere to that standard they
/could/ opt out of the test.

It's makes a lot of sense for linux filesystems to behave in consistent
ways, but if we're going to start enforcing that through xfstests we
need to be very clear about it, IMHO.
