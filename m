Hello,

This is second part of the split out of the larger series to clean up pagevec
APIs and provide ranged lookups. In this series I provide a ranged variant of
pagevec_lookup_tag() and use it in places where it makes sense. This series
removes some common code and it also has a potential for speeding up some
operations similarly as for pagevec_lookup_range() (but for now I can think
of only artificial cases where this happens).

I'd like to ask f2fs and Ceph people to have a look since changes there are
non-trivial. Review from other fs people is welcome.

Full series including dependencies can be also obtained from my git tree:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jack/linux-fs.git find_get_pages_range

Opinions and review welcome!

								Honza
