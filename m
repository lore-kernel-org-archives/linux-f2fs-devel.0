This was answered in the cover letter, quoted below:

I've written xfstests for the new APIs.  They test the APIs themselves
as well as verify the correctness of the ciphertext stored on-disk for
v2 encryption policies.  The tests can be found at:

	Repository:   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ebiggers/xfstests-dev.git
	Branch:       fscrypt-key-mgmt-improvements

The xfstests depend on new xfs_io commands which can be found at:

	Repository:   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ebiggers/xfsprogs-dev.git
	Branch:       fscrypt-key-mgmt-improvements

I've also made proof-of-concept changes to the 'fscrypt' userspace
program (https://github.com/google/fscrypt) to make it support v2
encryption policies.  You can find these changes in git at:

	Repository:   https://github.com/ebiggers/fscrypt.git
	Branch:       fscrypt-key-mgmt-improvements

To make the 'fscrypt' userspace program experimentally use v2 encryption
policies on new encrypted directories, add the following to
/etc/fscrypt.conf within the "options" section:

	"policy_version": "2"

Finally, it's also planned for Android and Chromium OS to switch to the
new ioctls and eventually to v2 encryption policies.  Work-in-progress,
proof-of-concept changes by Satya Tangirala for AOSP can be found at
