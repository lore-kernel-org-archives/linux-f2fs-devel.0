Let me quote:
: Sigh.  We've resisted doing this because vmalloc() is somewhat of a bad
: thing, and we don't want to make it easy for people to do bad things.
: 
: And vmalloc is bad because a) it's slow and b) it does GFP_KERNEL
: allocations for page tables and c) it is susceptible to arena
: fragmentation.
: 
: We'd prefer that people fix their junk so it doesn't depend upon large
: contiguous allocations.  This isn't userspace - kernel space is hostile
: and kernel code should be robust.
: 
: So I dunno.  Should we continue to make it a bit more awkward to use
: vmalloc()?  Probably that tactic isn't being very successful - people
: will just go ahead and open-code it.  And given the surprising amount
: of stuff you've placed in kvmalloc_node(), they'll implement it
: incorrectly...
: 
: How about we compromise: add kvmalloc_node(), but include a BUG_ON("you
: suck") to it?

While I agree with some of those points, the reality really sucks,
though. We have tried the same tactic with __GFP_NOFAIL and failed as
well. I guess we should just bite the bullet and provide an api which is
so common that people keep reinventing their own ways around that, many
times wrongly or suboptimally. BUG_ON("you suck") is just not going to
help much I am afraid.

What do you think Andrew?
