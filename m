When the ext4 code was first posted, I noted that 90% of the
implementation was not ext4 specific at all. I asked that the
encryption part of it be lifted to fs/ and the API made generic so
that it can be shared without needing to copy and re-review
encryption code (which is notoriously hard to get right) when others
implement the same fucntionality. This was considered SEP.

Yes, they did, even though I asked them not to, but to instead pull
all the code that is non-ext4 specific up to the VFS first and then
use that. Again, this was considered SEP.

Yes, unfortunately you're the first "somebody else" who is going to
have to deal with this problem. It's not just the API - most of the
encryption implementation is also copy and pasted, too.

This simply hasn't got to the top of my list of stuff to do for XFS
yet, so I haven't started down this path yet. However, if you do
start on the hard work  to pull all this stuff up into the VFS and
generic helpers, I'll do what I can to get the necessary parts of
XFS working with it as well....

Yes, so that when someone factors it all into a generic
implementation the new "FS_IOC*" ioctl API will be binary compatible
with the existing ext4 and f2fs ioctl implementations and the
existing userspace tools will just continue to work.

Yes, it should have been done that way in the first place.

Yes, we should. Having a single set of policies implemented and
enforced at the VFS is how this should be done. Users will
absolutely hate us if per-file encryption devolves into APIs and
policies that differ between filesystems.

Cheers,
