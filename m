Thanks to Dave. :)

Change log from v4:
 o add mkfs in _require_scratch_shutdown
 o add _require_fiemap and _extent_hole_counts
 o add _require_logstate
 o modify xfs/086,087 output rules for the generic usage
 o add _get_log_configs to introduce consistent testing options
 o add _get_quota_option to define quota option for each filesystems

This patch-set modifies several existing xfs's tests to be used by generic
filesystems.

1. FS requirement

In order to activate these testcases, filesystem should support a new feature,
shutdown, triggered by the following ioctl command.

#define FS_IOC_SHUTDOWN _IOR('X', 125, __u32)   /* Shutdown */

This ioctl needs one of three modes passed by a flag according to the syncing
policy.

#define FS_GOING_DOWN_FULLSYNC  0x0     /* going down with full sync */
#define FS_GOING_DOWN_METASYNC  0x1     /* going down with metadata */
#define FS_GOING_DOWN_NOSYNC    0x2     /* going down */

Whenever shutdown is requested with one of the above mode, filesystem must
stop any IOs, and wait for unmount, which is very useful to test power-off-
recovery.

2. Changes in xfstests

In this patch set, common/rc adds macros:
 o _require_scratch_shutdown : check whether FS supports shutdown
 o _require_fiemap           : check bmap tool is defined
 o _require_norecovery       : check filesystem supports norecovery option.
 o _require_logstate         : check logstate tools is defined
 o _get_log_configs          : define mount options for tests
 o _get_quota_option         : define quota options for filesystems

 The following tests become generic.
  xfs/053 -> generic/042
  xfs/137 -> generic/043
  xfs/138 -> generic/044
  xfs/139 -> generic/045
  xfs/140 -> generic/046
  xfs/179 -> generic/047
  xfs/180 -> generic/048
  xfs/182 -> generic/049
  xfs/200 -> generic/050
  xfs/306 -> generic/051

  xfs/085 -> generic/052
  xfs/086 -> generic/054
  xfs/087 -> generic/055
