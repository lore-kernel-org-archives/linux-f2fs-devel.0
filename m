Hmm, in my case, all the filesystems show without that line.

It seems that hexdump gives that differently. When I tested od, I could get this
from all the filesystems.

od /mnt/test/testfile
0000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000
*
0000060 000000
0000062

Let me change the patch to use od.

Thanks,
