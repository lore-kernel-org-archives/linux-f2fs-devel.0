Not all filesystems use the block layer, hint: UBIFS.

No dm-crypt available in MTD land.

Well, let's focus first on file contents.
We have already the fscrypo framework.

What you suggest is completely different from what we have now.

The hardware offers AES-CBC, accessible via the kernel crypto API.
