This is what we think as well. We have posted this as a separate
thread to confirm this with other btrfs developers.

I don't think fsck tools are very useful here: fsck could return the
file system to an empty state, and that would still be consistent.
fsck makes no guarantees about data loss. I think fsck is allow to
truncate files, remove directory entries etc. which could lead to data
loss.

But I agree the guarantees haven't been formalized.

This is a great idea! We will be submitting the basic CrashMonkey
paper soon, so I don't know if we have enough time to do this.
Currently, we just explicitly say this behavior is supported by ext4,
but not btrfs, etc. So the bugs are file-system specific. But we would
definitely consider doing this in the future.

Btw, such models are what we introduced in the ALICE paper that Ted
had mentioned before. We called them "Abstract Persistence Models",
but it was essentially the same idea.

I agree that total ordering might lead to performance loss. I'm not
advocating for btrfs/F2FS to be totally ordered; I merely want them to
be clear about what guarantees they do provide.
