Subject: [PATCH 0/8 v4] make xfs/tests generic by introducing shutdown for filesystems

This patch-set modifies several existing xfs's tests to be used by generic
filesystems.

1. FS requirement

In order to activate these testcases, filesystem should support a new feature,
shutdown, triggered by the following ioctl command.

#define FS_IOC_SHUTDOWN _IOR('X', 125, __u32)   /* Shutdown */

This ioctl needs one of three modes passed by a flag according to the syncing
policy.

#define FS_GOING_DOWN_FULLSYNC  0x0     /* going down with full sync */
#define FS_GOING_DOWN_METASYNC  0x1     /* going down with metadata */
#define FS_GOING_DOWN_NOSYNC    0x2     /* going down */

Whenever shutdown is requested with one of the above mode, filesystem must
stop any IOs, and wait for unmount, which is very useful to test power-off-
recovery.

2. Changes in xfstests

In this patch set, common/rc adds three macros:
 o _require_scratch_shutdown : check whether FS supports shutdown
 o _require_bmap             : check bmap tool is defined
 o _require_norecovery       : check filesystem supports norecovery option.

 The following tests become generic.
    xfs/051 -> generic/051
  * xfs/053 -> generic/054
    xfs/085 -> generic/085
    xfs/086 -> generic/086
    xfs/087 -> generic/087
    xfs/137 -> generic/137
    xfs/138 -> generic/138
    xfs/139 -> generic/139
    xfs/140 -> generic/140
    xfs/179 -> generic/179
    xfs/180 -> generic/180
    xfs/182 -> generic/182
    xfs/200 -> generic/200
  * xfs/306 -> generic/305

*) changed test numbers due to conflict.
