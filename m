Hmm, your patch tries to change the return value and make its usage more
consistent. So, I think it should have been considered to change if (err < 0)
to if (err) entirely in order to avoid any potential mistake; this patch already
addresses it in some cases, but not all.

e.g., in f2fs_symlink,

	err = fscrypt_fname_usr_to_disk(inode, &istr, &ostr);
	if (err < 0)
		goto err_out;

BTW, in dx_show_leaf(),
	res = fscrypt_fname_disk_to_usr(dir,
		0, 0, &de_name,
		&fname_crypto_str);
	if (res < 0)
		...

IMHO, it'd be better to use err instead of {res|ret} when considering naming
convention.

Thanks,
