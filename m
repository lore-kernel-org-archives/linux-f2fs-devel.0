whoa... I will admit to having poorly reviewed this test.  Given that this file was
never fsynced, I don't think the test should be looking at file contents *at all*
I'll do an ex post facto review, I think, and really, I think all of the above should
just be removed from the test.  Without fsync, we don't know what's in the file.
(ext3 could be mounted with writeback mode, for example).
