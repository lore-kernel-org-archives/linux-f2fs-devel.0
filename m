The problem was that the kernel supported reading a file whose contents was
encrypted with CTS, which is only supposed to be used for filenames.  This was
inconsistent with FS_IOC_SET_ENCRYPTION_POLICY which currently only allows XTS
for contents and CTS for filenames.  So in other words I wanted to eliminate a
strange scenario that was not intended to happen and was almost certainly never
tested.

Either way, new modes can still be added if there is a good reason to do so.
What new encryption modes are you thinking of adding, would they be for contents
or for filenames, and are you thinking they would be offered by all filesystems
(ext4 and f2fs too)?
