Hello,

Actually, I tried to prepare this quite long time ago [1], which was stuck
that moment unfortunately, since I needed to wait for how AOSP finally treats
with this feature. At some moment later, I couldn't even follow up every ext4
changes into this patch set, since the feature was not quickly settled down in
AOSP rather than what I expected.

But, now it seems that there's no strong reason to postpone this work any more.
If Ted doen't mind, I'd like to investigate all the diffs between ext4 and f2fs
first. And, in the mean time, let me get any comments about missing or ugly
design points in this patch set.
(Please, take a look at its basic approach only.)

[1] http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/jaegeuk/f2fs.git/log/?h=crypto

This patch set adds the following files.
 - include/linux/fscrypt.h
 - fs/crypto/crypto.c
 - fs/crypto/policy.c
 - fs/crypto/keyinfo.c
 - fs/crypto/fname.c

And, it adds the below function pointers for each filesystems.

struct fscrypt_operations {
	int (*get_context)(struct inode *, void *, size_t, void *);
	int (*set_context)(struct inode *, const void *, size_t, int, void *);
	bool (*is_encrypted)(struct inode *);
	bool (*empty_dir)(struct inode *);
	unsigned (*max_namelen)(struct inode *);
};

Thanks,
