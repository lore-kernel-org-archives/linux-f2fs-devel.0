This is the sanest approach, because encrypting filesystem internal
metadata may have some unintended consequences. e.g being unable to
perform forensic analysis of corruption or data loss events, or an
inability for tools like fsck to work without also implementing all
the encryption code in userspace and being provided with all the
keys needed to decrypt the metadata.

i.e. it's not just the kernel code we have to consider here when
discussing this level of encryption in filesystems - the impact
on the entire support ecosystem needs to be considered. A weakness
in a fsck tool will be just as serious as a weakness in the kernel
code, and there's a much larger amount of widely dispersed code that
would need to be encryption enabled by going down this path.

Cheers,

Dave.
