A single tfm is fully-reentrant (as long as you don't change the
key).  So multiple reads/writes on a single file can all use one
tfm with no locking at all.

There should be a single tfm per key.  As your code appears to use
one key per inode, that translates to one tfm per inode.

We already have some support for such parallelisation in the form of
pcrypt.  It has been used on IPsec and I believe dmcrypt.

As long as an inode only has one key, you don't need any
serialisation.
