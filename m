When I took a closer look at clean and dirty logs in xfs, I thought that they
are very similar to the f2fs's logs.
If it is correct that the dirty log in xfs means that there are something to
replay metadata operations, I think f2fs can also detect them in a same manner.

So, actually I've already been testing xfs/086 and xfs/087 on f2fs having clean
and dirty log statement (which is retrieved by f2fs-tools).

Additionally, I've found that f2fs can be added into:
 xfs/051
 xfs/085

Anyway, if you think these are still not proper testcases, let me know.

Thank you for the list. :)
I'll check and try to follow the rule for _requires_foo.
