Yes, that API is better -- though, *setting* the fs-verity bit will likely be
done through its own ioctl (tentatively called FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY) as it will
involve more work than simply flipping the bit.  So for *getting* it we maybe
should just add it as a statx attribute, and not use the GETFLAGS or GETXATTR
ioctls at all.

But right now the real problem is that f2fs is using the FS_* namespace for its
on-disk ->i_flags (other than a few in the f2fs-specific ->i_advise), which
gives the impression that all new f2fs on-disk flags need to be exposed through
FS_IOC_GETFLAGS/SETFLAGS, and also reserved for ext4 as well...
