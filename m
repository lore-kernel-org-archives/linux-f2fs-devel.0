Hi Ted,

Thanks for the reply.

I agree the semantics are vaguely defined. On the other hand, we would
like to have rigorous testing of crash-consistency semantics, beyond
the ad-hoc collection of tests present in xfstests right now. That's
why these discussions are important.

To be clear, we absolutely do not want to test stuff the community
does not care about. But since its not exactly written down anywhere,
our best course of action is to engage in discussion and figure out it
piece by piece.

I was one of the authors on that paper, and I didn't know until today
you didn't like that work :) The paper did *not* suggest we support
invented guarantees without considering the performance impact.

As academics, it is our job to analyze existing solutions, and propose
what could be. I think this is healthy -- it is up-to developers
themselves to figure out what it is they want to support, and what
they don't want to support.

I don't disagree with any of this. But you can imagine how this can be
all be confusing to file-system developers and research groups who
work on file systems: without formal documentation, what exactly
should they test or support? Clearly current file systems provide more
than just POSIX and therefore POSIX itself is not very useful.

But in any case, coming back to our main question, the conclusion
seems to be: symlinks aren't standard, so we shouldn't be studying
their crash-consistency properties. This is useful to know. Thanks!
