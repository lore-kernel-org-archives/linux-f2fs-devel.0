Can you split this into two patches? The first simply does this:

#define PF_MEMALLOC_NOFS PF_FSTRANS

and changes only the XFS code to use PF_MEMALLOC_NOFS.

The second patch can then do the rest of the mm API changes that we
don't actually care about in XFS at all.  That way I can carry all
the XFS changes in the XFS tree and not have to worry about when
this stuff gets merged or conflicts with the rest of the work that
is being done to the mm/ code and whatever tree that eventually
lands in...

Cheers,

Dave.
