It's interesting, but it really applies only to metadata updates
since really we normally only journal metadata. We do not
consider extended attributes to be metadata, do we ?

Ok, I am confused. Clearly ext4, nor xfs consider xattrs metadata
which can be tested simply by attaching xattr and crashing the file
system immediately afterwards - the new xattr will not be there -
that's expected for data, but unexpected for metadata.

Now the fact that it works might be just a coincidence. Btw in the
discussion Dave never mentioned xattr, he only talks about inode
size and extent list changes which makes sense since those are
metadata and it's expected to be "stabilised" as he very well
described. I just do not think this applies to this case.

Also I think that his wording that fsync on the file implies fsync
on the directory is unfortunate because it does not. However it
implies that the directory will actually be stabilised as well due
to journalling. But the results are the same.

Anyway, maybe Dave can sprinkle some of his wisdom over this...
