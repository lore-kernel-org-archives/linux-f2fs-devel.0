Ted and others, what would you say about allocating FS_VERITY_FL as one of the
unused ext4 / "VFS" inode flags like 0x01000000, or maybe 0x00000400 if the
compression flags aren't being used anymore?

I do wish that we separated the on-disk flags namespaces from the
FS_IOC_GETFLAGS/FS_IOC_SETFLAGS namespace though...  Then adding the flag to
each namespace could be done separately which would make more sense.  As-is, the
flags are all being conflated, so by allocating a flag in f2fs ->i_flags we
would effectively also be allocating it for ext4 and for the UAPI, which we
don't necessarily need to do yet.

The fs-verity file format is not finalized, but in any case there will need to
be a superblock flag and a per-inode flag that indicates whether it is enabled.
There will also be a version number built into the fs-verity metadata, so the
file format can be updated without having to change to using a different
per-inode flag.
