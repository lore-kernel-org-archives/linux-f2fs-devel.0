I partially understand where you are coming from, but your argument
seems to boil down to "don't say anything until you have worked out
every detail". I don't agree with this. Yes, it was speculative, but
we did have a fairly clear disclaimer.

To the point about it being obvious: you might be surprised at how
many people outside this community take it for granted that if you
fsync a file, only that file's contents and metadata will be persisted
:) So it was obvious to you, but truly shocking for many.

Btw, ext3-fast is what led to our CCFS work in FAST 17:
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/papers/fast17-c2fs.pdf. In this paper,
we do show that if you divide your application writes into streams, it
is possible to persist only the data/metadata of one stream,
independent of the IO being done in other streams. So as it turned
out, it wasn't an impossible file-system design.

But we digress. I think we both agree that researchers should engage
more with the file-system community.

There are two ways to look at this.

1. A/bar does not exist, link count is 1, and so it is not a bug.

2. We are calling fsync on the inode when the inode's link count is 2.
So it should persist the inode plus the dependency that is A/bar. The
file system after a crash should show both A/bar and the file with
link count 2. This is what ext4, xfs, and F2FS do.

We've posted separately to figure out what semantics btrfs supports.
