It's used to implement the test_dummy_encryption mount option for ext4, which is
used by the 'ext4/encrypt' config for gce-xfstests.  Its purpose is to cause all
new files (directories, regular files, and symlinks) to be automatically
encrypted with a default key, so that the encrypted I/O paths are tested more
thoroughly than by just running the 'encrypt' group tests.

There are no backward compatibility concerns with changing or removing the
test_dummy_encryption mount option; we just don't have a better solution yet.

Ideally, instead of using test_dummy_encryption we would encrypt the root
directory of the filesystem immediately after it is formatted.  However, that
doesn't work for ext4 because the lost+found directory has to be located in the
root directory, and must be unencrypted, and the lost+found directory entry must
be unencrypted.

So I think getting rid of test_dummy_encryption depends on a solution to the
lost+found problem.

An alternative would be to add support for "inherit-only" encryption policies,
then set such a policy on the root directory of the filesystem.  But, there
haven't been any requests for such a feature yet outside of this specific
testing-only use case, so I've been hesitant to add it.
