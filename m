At which point, I have to ask, why not just use dm-crypt and
implement a simple "use device key on bio contents if none has been
specified by higher layer" mechanism to direct the encryption?  It's
simple, you can still offload the crypto to your hardware, requires
minimal extra plumbing, and no userspace tooling changes. This
allows the user data on a dm-crypt to be encrypted with a user
specified key so even is the device key is compromised their data is
not (and vice versa).

As for non-block device filesystems like UBIFS, I'd suggest that
their "storage layer" that the filesytem sits on top of could do the
same thing - any request that doesn't have a key supplied gets
encrypted using the device key. i.e. the filesystem layers use the
same implementation, but the underlying storage device implements
the encryption interface according to the requirements of the
subsystem.

i.e. I don't think we should be trying to implement a single layer
that supports both block and non-block filesystems here. However, we
can still architect a solution where the filesystem level code is
independent of the underlying storage encryption implementation.  In
this sort of architecture, the filesystem only does key management
and deals with unencrypted data and metadata, whilst the underlying
storage layer implements the (hardware accelerated) encryption as
the data passes through...

Cheers,

Dave.
