Well, the point of the test case is to catch recovery behaviour
that is not properly ordered in this complex corner case. It's not
an obvious thing for developers to test, as we can see by both btrfs
and now f2fs failing this test.

What that failure actually means and implies is completely separate
to the test itself. i.e. the test is just a canary that tells us a
filesystem is not strictly ordered in it's crash recovery behaviour.
If we don't have tests somewhere that exercise the behaviour we want
filesystems to have, we'll never know if a filesystem does or
doesn't behave as we want them to.

The fact we'd like all filesystems to have strictly ordered crash
recovery semantics has nothing to do with the test. It's based on
the fact that XFS and ext3/4 have had this behaviour since forever,
and apps written on these filesystems are quite likely to skip
the directory fsync() because it's not necessary. That's seen by
btrfs users reporting lost files where other filesystems are fine.

We want all linux filesystems to behave the same way in these
circumstances, but we can't enforce it because....

... that is a option the filesystem developers can take.

xfstests is not the way we enforce it - it's just tells us something
is inconsistent. What the fs developers do from there (fix it or
skip the test) is up to them.

Cheers,

Dave.
