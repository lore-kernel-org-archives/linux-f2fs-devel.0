Thanks for your quick response!
I hoped you had already some code, but having a decent design document
is also nice. I'm eager to read it.

Do you also plan to address d/page cache related issues?
i.e. when two users are logged into the system user rw
is able to see decrypted file names and contents in /home/dags/
if user dags installs a key and accessed a file.

Or files in /home/dags/ are still readable even after
user dags purged the key.

The tool could play games with CLONE_NEWNS to hide directories.
To provide a correct "logout" we could expose shrink_dcache_parent()
to usespace such that the emerging tool can purge the key and flush
the dcache on the encrypted directory. But I fear exposing shrink_dcache_parent()
is not a good idea. :-)

Just some random ideas...

Thanks,
//richard
