I agree that it is likely that specific KDF implementations may only be use=

once. But still, I would recommend to maintain those implementation under t=

crypto API umbrella, as KDFs are cryptographic operations.

I concur with you. I have implemented the HKDF in my libkcapi as well and s=

the need for a salt.

Let me work on an update to the KDF patch for the kernel crypto API.
