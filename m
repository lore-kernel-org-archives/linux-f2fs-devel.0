I don't think this is what the paper's ext3-fast does. All the paper
says is if you have a file system where the fsync of a file persisted
only data related to that file, it would increase performance.
ext3-fast is the name given to such a file system. Note that we do not
present a design of ext3-fast or analyze it in any detail. In fact, we
explicitly say "The ext3-fast file system (derived from inferences
provided by ALICE) seems interesting for application safety, though
further investigation is required into the validity of its design."

I definitely agree it takes time and effort. I'm hoping our work on
CrashMonkey can help here, by codifying the crash-consistency
guarantees into tests that new file-system developers can use.

I agree with this criticism. This is why my research group engages
with the file-system community right from project start, as we have
been doing with CrashMonkey.

Thanks! As I mentioned before, this is useful. I have a follow-up
question. Consider the following workload:

 creat foo
 link (foo, A/bar)
 fsync(foo)
 crash

In this case, after the file system recovers, do we expect foo's link
count to be 2 or 1? I would say 2, but POSIX is silent on this, so
thought I would confirm. The tricky part here is we are not calling
fsync() on directory A.

In this case, its not a symlink; its a hard link, so I would say the
link count for foo should be 2. But btrfs and F2FS show link count of
1 after a crash.
