Sure, but what would be the benefit of doing different things on the
back end?  I think this is a really more of a philophical objection
than anything else.  With both fsverity and fscrypt, well over 95% of
the implementation is shared between ext4 and f2fs.  And from a
cryptographic design, that's something I consider a feature, not a
bug.  Cryptographic code is subtle in very different ways compared to
file system code.  So it's a good thing to having it done once and
audited by crypto specialists, as opposed to having each file system
doing it differently / independently.

Right, the current interface makes it somewhat more awkward to do
these other things --- but the question is *why* would you want to in
the first place?  Why add the extra complexity?  I'm a big believer of
the KISS principle, and if there was a reason why a file system would
want to store the Merkle tree somewhere else, we could talk about it,
but I see only downside, and no upside.
