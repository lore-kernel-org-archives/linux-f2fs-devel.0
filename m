For UBIFS the story is a bit different. UBIFS operates on a kmap()'ed
page and has already a temporary buffer where it prepares and compresses data.
So, I can use in-place encryption. All I have to do is massaging the fscrypt
interface to allow the filesystem to select when a bouncing page (or buffer in
my case) is needed or not.
I've extended the fscrypt API already to work on buffers too.
In MTD world we don't have struct bio and other fancy stuff. :-)
