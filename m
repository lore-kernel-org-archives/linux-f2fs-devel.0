So what you are really saying is that f2fs is not strictly ordered
w.r.t metadata crash consistency after fsync()? Wasn't that
considered a bug in btrfs that had to be fixed (and did get fixed)?

Oh, yeah, it's right there in the test commit history:

commit f02fe949113f35ae221ec1ab5c9959912f594bf4
Author: Filipe Manana <fdmanana@suse.com>

    generic: add test for fsync after renaming file
    
    Test that if we rename a file, create a new file that has the old name
    of the other file and is a child of the same parent directory, fsync the
    new inode, power fail and mount the filesystem, we do not lose the first
    file and that file has the name it was renamed to.
    
    This test is motivated by an issue found in btrfs which is fixed by the
    following patch for the linux kernel:
    
      "Btrfs: fix file loss caused by fsync after rename and new inode"

There's a whole lot more detail in the kernel commit 2be63d5ce929
("Btrfs: fix file loss on log replay after renaming a file and
fsync") but my point is that we considered this a btrfs filesystem
bug and so changing the test defeats it's purpose as a regression
test for the btrfs bug.

So IMO the test should not be changed. And I think we should be
consistent and consider this f2fs failure as a f2fs bug that needs
fixing to bring it's behaviour in line with xfs, ext4, and btrfs.

Remember this when quoting POSIX about fsync behaviour: Posix is a
terrible standard when it comes to data integrity. We go way, way
beyond what POSIX specifies as a valid fsync implementation (i.e.
posix allows "do nothing and return success" as a conformant
implementation). Ext4, XFS and btrfs all have strictly ordered
metadata crash recovery semantics and all of the crash recovery
tests expect this behaviour from the filesytem being tested. The
underlying intention is that by encoding it into these tests, all
widely used and future linux filesystems meet or exceed this crash
integrity requirement.

IOWs, changing the test is the wrong thing to do on many levels....

Cheers,

Dave.
