wow :D

Different mdsums for different file systems and

"file 'hello' has expected size and content"

You have to have some fun from time to time ;)

I can not tell whether the content of the file is important, or
whether the explicit fsync on the file defeats the purpose of the
test, but the easier would be to just fsync the file and then print
out md5sum since it should be always the same no matter what file
system you use.

Or we can just not test the content of the file at all. But
regardless of the decision we do not need this patch.

Felipe what would be the best solution ?

Thanks!
