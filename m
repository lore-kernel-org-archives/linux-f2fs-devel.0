Hum, my testing (on a 3.19 kernel) for both ext4 and xfs shows me
something different.
Perhaps we're testing differently.

So I just replaced the the line that adds a hard link to our inode with=
:

$SETFATTR_PROG -n user.attr4 -v val4 $SCRATCH_MNT/foobar

Then after the crash + mount, the new xattr is listed (with the
correct value val4).
I also tried the variants of leaving the 'ln' command and adding the
xattr either right before or right after the 'ln' command. For both
cases, the new xattr was there after crash + mount.

How did you test?

Correct, I assumed his explanation applied to metadata in general and
I'm considering xattrs as metadata (though as I said before, it's not
unreasonable to consider them as data as well imho).

Yes :)
