Indeed, Chandan Rajendra sent out a new version of the patch which fixes the
problem (by removing the 'select BLOCK' from fs/ubifs/Kconfig), but it never
made it into the fscrypt tree and hence never made it into linux-next.

Ted, what you are planning to do with the fscrypt tree following the fsverity
discussion?  IMO, we should keep the fsverity stuff in its own branch, separate
from any fscrypt changes.  As a suggestion, in the branch "fscrypt" of my
linux.git repo [1], I applied just these four patches on top of v5.0-rc1 and
resolved the conflicts with them no longer being on top of fsverity:

	fscrypt: remove CRYPTO_CTR dependency
	ext4: use IS_ENCRYPTED() to check encryption status
	f2fs: use IS_ENCRYPTED() to check encryption status
	fscrypt: remove filesystem specific build config option

(The last patch is the fixed version.)

Please consider doing the same with the official fscrypt tree.  Thanks!
