Yes, I see that UBIFS encryption just got merged yesterday, so I'll send a
version that updates UBIFS too.  And it seems the
fscrypt_has_permitted_context() call in ubifs_lookup() is missing, so I'll add
that too.

I'm wondering if it would make more sense to do a separate patch for each
filesystem?  But in this case the filesystem changes are dependent on the prior
patches to fs/crypto/, so they can't simply be sent through the per-filesystem
trees unless each one merges in the fs/crypto/ changes too.
