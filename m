That would work as an immediate mitigation. No question about that but
what I've tried to point out in the reply to Dave is that longerm we
shouldn't hide this trickiness inside the vmalloc and rather handle
those users who are requesting NOFS/NOIO context from vmalloc. We
already have a scope api for NOIO and I want to add the same for NOFS.
I believe that much more sane approach is to use the API at those places
which really start/stop reclaim recursion dangerous scope (e.g. the
transaction context) rather than using GFP_NOFS randomly because this
approach has proven to not work properly over years. We have so many
place using GFP_NOFS just because nobody bothered to think whether it is
needed but it must be safe for sure that it is not funny.
