We currently have one case where our embedded platform is only able to do AES-CBC in hardware, not AES-XTS. So switching to AES-CBC for file contents would yield far better performance while still being "secure enough".

Generally speaking though, it would be great to have encryption _and_ authentication for file contents. AEAD modes like GCM or future finalists of the CAESAR competition come to mind. IIRC the ext4 encryption design document mentions this, but it's unclear to me why AES-GCM wasn't used for file contents from the beginning. I'd guess it has to do with where to store the authentication tag and performance.
Does anybody have details on that?

Thanks,
David
