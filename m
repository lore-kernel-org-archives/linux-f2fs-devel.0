I'm not sure I follow the forensics use-case for immutable btime. I'd
expect dm-verity or selinux/apparmor audits to do a better job for those
worried about this kind of attack.

Samba currently uses a user.DOSATTRIB xattr for tracking creation time.
IMO a mutable btime accessible via statx would be useful for
cross-protocol interoperability.
