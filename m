fscrypt_fname_usr_to_disk() already returned a length in the "." and ".." cases.
So any caller which assumed it returned 0 on success would have already been
buggy.  Fortunately, there aren't any such callers currently.

I agree that the return value is redundant and somewhat error prone.  However,
this style is already being used for fscrypt_fname_disk_to_usr(),
fscrypt_fname_usr_to_disk(), and fname_decrypt().  My patch was primarily
intended to make things more consistent by updating fname_encrypt(), which was
the odd one out.  If you'd prefer, I can instead do a patch to make all these
related functions return 0 on success, rather than a length.  That would be a
somewhat larger patch.
