Agreeed.

IMO, according to comments of generic/342, it wants to test posix sematic
that supported by current fs' fsync(), if we want to test dirsync mount
option, that would be better in another testcase?

Agreed, in order to maximize performance of fsync regular file, we'd better
not change current sematic of f2fs' fsync so far, moreover, there is no
such requirement from upper layer application.

Some applications use its own database software layer instead generic
sqlite in android, and they use deletion mode in their database, so
whenever they trigger database transaction, we need to do checkpoint. There
is such scenario that, before checkpoint it comes huge number of node &
meta updating, result in that checkpoint becomes very slow.

Maybe we can consider to fsync checkpointed directory with the way fsyncing
regular file rather than triggering checkpoint to improve its performance?

We have supported that yet in commit b7e1d800031c ("f2fs: implement -o
dirsync"). ;)
