Agreed too. Or, how about using "-o dirsync"?

Indeed. Actually, since one of our goals was to reduce fsync latencies for
Android, we decided to support posix in a minimum way. In order to avoid
complex directory updates recursively, however, we allowed the fsync on
directories to trigger checkpoint requiring many IO operations.

IMHO, as a quick fix, it seems we need to handle MS_DIRSYNC likewse xfs.
#define MS_DIRSYNC      128     /* Directory modifications are synchronous */
