Well, I didn't want to play this games in the generic kvmalloc, at least
not now, because all the converted users didn't really need it so far
and I believe that the existing users need a) inspection to check
whether NO{FS,IO} context is really needed and b) I still believe that
the scope nofs api should be used longterm rather than an explicit
GFP_NOFS. I am already working on ext[34] code.
