Hi Richard,

In my opinion consolidating the copy_from/to_user() is worthwhile by itself.
The filesystem encryption code should be shared when possible, and right now
there's no reason for each filesystem to do its own copy_from/to_user().

The renaming to fscrypt_ioctl_* is also important because it makes it clear that
the functions implement ioctls.  I've already fixed four bugs in the "set
policy" ioctl, and I think these bugs would have been more obvious with a
clearer code organization.
