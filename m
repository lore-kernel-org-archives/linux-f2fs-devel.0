My bad.

I added this check because while doing the btrfs fix I came into a
scenario where the file's metadata was inconsistent (i.e. the dir
fsync would cause metadata inconsistency for non-empty child files).
This was detected by fsck alone, but then I added this check anyway.

(Felipe -> Filipe :))

I think explicitly fsyncing the file, after fsyncing the directory,
and then check its md5sum/content is a good thing to test. Like this
we know there's only one expected result for all filesystems. I'll
send a patch for that soon.
