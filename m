Nope.

You are seeing an unintentional fsync of parent, because both
parent update and symlink update are metadata updates that are
tracked by the same transaction.

fsync of symlink forces the current transaction to the journal,
pulling in the parent update with it.

fsync of regular file behaves differently than fsync of non regular file.
I suggest this read:

No pattern detecting by xfs/ext4 AFAIK.
rename does not change metadata of victim, so fsync(bar)
may (depending on fs) trigger no metadata transaction commit.

Thanks,
