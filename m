Yes, that makes sense if UBIFS is going to be using the code too.  Feel free to
propose a patch.  As I understand it, the assumption would be that if a
filesystem needs the block-specific functions in fs/crypto/, then it itself
would necessarily already depend on CONFIG_BLOCK.  It should work to just
conditionally compile the block-specific functions based on CONFIG_BLOCK, either
via #ifdefs or by having a separate file like fs/crypto/block.c and putting
'fscrypto-$(CONFIG_BLOCK) += block.o' in fs/crypto/Makefile.  The separate file
sounds preferable.
