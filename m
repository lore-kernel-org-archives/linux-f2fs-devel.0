Good idea --- I agree that "iv" is a better name, so as to not tie the code to
XTS specifically.  But I think the renaming should be a separate patch.

Also, currently this code *is* only supposed to be used for XTS.  There's a bug
where a specially crafted filesystem can cause this code path to be entered with
CTS, but I have a patch pending in the ext4 tree to fix that.
